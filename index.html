      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a Digital Production Artist who studied at Carnegie Mellon University for a Bachelor of Arts and a Minor in Architecture. I love the outdoors but also playing video and board games with friends. I’m thankful for my girlfriend Carolyn and our Chihuahua Jack Russle mix, Bilbo Waggins, for keeping me company through this crazy last year!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Durham, North Carolina but moved to San Francisco, California  when I was 1. When I was 4 I moved to Cleveland, Ohio. I lived there till college started in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and eventually ended up in Seattle, Washington.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Archaeologist/Geologist. I love uncovering beautiful mysteries in the Earth!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I feel it is an important skill to have especially when I have so many ideas I’d like to make available to the public and interactive. I have an interest in data science and love making engaging visualizations that may find a home on the web. Also some job stability might be nice too, haha!</p>
